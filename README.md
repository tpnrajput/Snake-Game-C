In this game the player is given with a rectangular boundary along with snake and 
a fruit (primarily, a dot/square), 
the snake is allowed to move right-left-top and bottom 
and as it eats the fruit its size grows 
and points increases and as the snake collide with THE BOUNDARY THE GAME GETS OVER.
